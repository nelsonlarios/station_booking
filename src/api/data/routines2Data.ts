If they are taking the shuttle slightly late then a soft lay off would be best although still being threatening in their movement.",

The worker should also focus on their shot placement choices (especially when they are fatiguing).",

The feeder needs to make sure it is not too easy but also not too difficult. The shuttle should be quite close to the net on the throw so they have to play underneath it. The worker should have a focus on keeping their legs low, controlling their body when deep lunging. They should aim to still play tight net shots whilst moving fast and under pressure.",
