If the worker hits a shot with pace the feeder should not play a quick shot cross court as this would likely be their partners in a match. The feeder should however ensure they are making it difficult for the worker, twisting and turning them whilst also allowing them to attack most of the time.",

A focus should also be on committing forward to play aggressive shots in the mid court and then still being able to move backwards to get the lift.",

The worker should focus on having short swings with their elbow high. They also need to hit and recover quickly whilst changing their grip efficiently. The worker should also focus on their shot placement choices (especially when they are fatiguing).",

Then feed to the alternate side just after the worker has played their shot, ensuring they have just enough time to be in a good position. The worker should focus on using their non-racket leg in their movement to the shuttle, focus on hitting crisp drives. The worker should also be ready to explode up to a flat lift and intercept it early.",

The worker should focus on being low in their stance and powering off from both legs to quickly retrieve the shuttle. The feeder should aim to throw the shuttle out of the workers comfort zone but not so it is impossible. They can vary up the length of the feed so it doesn’t become predictable.",

This is a common pattern in doubles. The worker should play the first shot straight as if they play a cross-court smash then the straight drive reply would be their partners!",

      "Feeder should use a single shuttle on one half of the court and feed into the box zone (front out and back tramlines out). Try to make it difficult for the worker twisting and turning them at a stretch but also make it semi-realistic. Don’t return a smash hard cross court as this would usually be their partners. The worker should focus on short and sharp swings with the racket and maintaining fast feet, 1 set to each side. NO MISTAKES",
